# (Ford GoBike System Dataset)
## by (Antwi Bright Owusu)


## Dataset

The dataset consists of information regarding 183412 bikes hired during February 2019. It consists of various variables such as the duration of ride, the start and end stations where the ride  began and ended respectively, the gender and user type of the rider and other variables. I also extracted the day of ride and hour in which the ride was made for my analysis. The dataset is part of the Udacity curated dataset for the Data Analysis program and can be found on Udacity's servers. 


## Summary of Findings
My findings includes the following;
1.  I observed that the peak of the distribution of the duration seconds variable is between 250 and 500 secs. Over there we can realise a count greater than 25,000
2. With the day hired variable, I observed that Thursdays has the highest number of bicycle hired. I  also realize that there is a significant drop in the hiring of bicycles over the weekend.
3. With the hour hired variable, I realized that most bikes was hired at 8am in the morning and 5pm in the evening. This is quite expected because of the rush to and from work during this time.
4.  I realize that subscribers hire much more bicycles than customers when I considered the user type variable.
5. Males hire bicycles more than females and those of other genders when I considered the member gender variable.
6. I realized males ride more bicycles when I considered the relationship between the day hired and gender and the hour hired and gender variables respectively.
7. I realized subscribers ride more bicycles when I considered the relationship between the day hired and user type and the hour hired and user type variables respectively.
8. Interestingly, the other gender had a much higher average ride time over both male and female genders. This observation remains true when I considered it against the day and hour hired variables respectively.
9. Again customers had a higher average ride time against subscribers. This observation remains true when I considered it against the day and hour hired variables respectively.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For my presentation, I will focus on;
1. The changes in the number of rides across the days of the week.
2. The changes in the number of rides across the hours in the day.
3. Which of the genders had the highest average ride duration.
4. Which of the user types had the the highest ride duration.
